# Analysis of car accidents in Italy from 2011 to 2020 using Python

## Summary and projects goals
Car accidents are the reason of many deaths today. 

Our goal is to address the following questions:
- Which provinces and roads are more dangeours when driving a car in Italy?
- Is it possible to compute a synthetic score to measure how dangerous a province is when driving a car?

## Data
Data are provided by ACI and Istat. You can find and download the data here:

ACI: https://www.aci.it/laci/studi-e-ricerche/dati-e-statistiche/incidentalita/incidenti-strade-provinciali/2020.html

ISTAT: http://dati.istat.it/

Please note that some preliminary activities on data were carried on outside Python

## Insights
Data were analyzed in order to extract insights about:
- Which provinces and roads in Italy show highest numbers of car accidents, injured people and deaths
- How provinces could be clustered usign unsupervised learning
- Which is a synsthetic score for each provinces in order to measure level of danger
